Game Description:

Name - Military Training

This is a platform-based game in which the Soldier whom the user is able to control using 'WAS' including 'SPACE' to levitate.
But in order to levitate it is important to hold onto the 'SPACE' bar the longer a user holds onto the 'SPACE' bar the further higher
the soldier is likely to go.

Objective:
Collect all the ammo-crates then reach the flag to complete game.

Avoid:
Obstacles such as enemy Tank otherwise users health will be decremented by 1.
The same principle also applies for Spike Collisions which is another obstacle to avoid.

Controls:
W = Jump
A = Move Left
S = Move Right
SPACE BAR (hold) = Levitate

Consumables:
Heart = Collect the heart to refresh health and increment health count by 1.
Suprise Boxes = Collide with suprise box to find out what would happen to the users character.
(It would not be a suprise if I reveal this to you).
